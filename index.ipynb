Occassionally, with very ill formatted column names with quotations in the names themselves, you may even need to wrap a name in triple quotes `df[\"\"\"col_name\"\"\"]` . This will rarely happen in this particular context, but is also the general pattern for dealing with messy strings.   \n",

Similarly to tab completion with the command line, this is a primary reason why programers use dashes (-) and underscores (_) in lieu of whitespace in their variable and file names. Also note that no quotations are used when using this format. (The column names have been stored as attributes to the DataFrame object!)"

    "There are a number of other packages you can also check out for visualization later on such as plotly, folium, and bokeh to name a few, but matplotlib is an industry standard used widely. As with the pandas package, we must import  the matplotlib package to use its built in functions and methods. Rather then import the entire package however, we import only the piece we intend to use (hence the dot notation) and again alias this under the shorthand *plt*. Finally, the iPython magic command **% matplotlib inline** makes these graphs appear within our jupyter notebook."
